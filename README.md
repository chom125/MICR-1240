Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. What you see here is what you get. If you are interested in downloading all my labs through-out years 1, year 2, and year 3... **I have made all 608MB (packed full of 100% completion) available for download on Usenet**. Just search "rrc_labs_eet" under alt.binaries.e-book or via binsearch.info for the nzb file.

If you are not familiar with Usenet/don't have access to Usenet, I suggest doing a 1 month free trial via Giganews.com -- use SABnzbd on Windows or Linux and Unison or NZB Vortex 3 on MacOSX.
