Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. What you see here is what you get. If you are interested in downloading all my labs from years 1, year 2, and year 3... **I have made all 670.2MB (packed full of 100% completion) available for download on Usenet**. Just search "rrc_labs_eet" under alt.binaries.e-book or via binsearch.info for the nzb file.

If you are not familiar with Usenet/don't have access to Usenet, I recomend doing a 1 month free trial via Giganews.com -- Usenet is blazing fast compared to BitTorrent (upto 102MB/s transfer rates). 

Once you have rrc_labs_eet.zip downloaded, you may share it in any way or form (Megashare, Dropbox, etc...). Giganews will keep the files indexed in its usenet server for 5 years (till 2021).
