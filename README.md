**//discontinued...**

Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. All my labs from year 1,2,3 (600mb full of 100% completion) is now available for download to students who wish to use it as referance.

**Backup Link:** Should RRC or Github ask me to take down the link, an .nzb file is made avaiable for Usenet subscribers. It will remain on Giganews servers till 2021 | Alternatively you can just search **"rrc_labs_eet"** under **alt.binaries.e-book** or do a binsearch.info for rrc_labs_eet.zip for the nzb file.

As always, you are free to share, take credit, make money or do what ever you like with the files. My lab work is now public domain material.
