Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. I've made all my labs from year 1,2,3 public domain and (600mb full of 100% completion) is now available for download to students who wish to use it as referance. Feel free to share the file to everyone in your class (sharing is caring). Should the Mega download link fail, I've posted the file on Usenet as well.
