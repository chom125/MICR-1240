**//discontinued...**

Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. All my labs from year 1,2,3 (600mb full of 100% completion) is now available for download to students who wish to check thier work or meet deadlines. -- don't cheat, you paid money to learn... not to get a diploma.

**Download via Usenet:** The .nzb file is avaiable at http://www60.zippyshare.com/v/0MDlqTdN/file.html | Alternatively you can just search **"rrc_labs_eet"** under **alt.binaries.e-book** or do a binsearch.info for rrc_labs_eet.zip for the nzb file. If you're desperate to download the file but don't have a Usenet subscription, Giganews.com offers a 1mo. free trial (Credit Card req.). I highly suggest you try them out.
