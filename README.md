**//discontinued...**

Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. All my labs from year 1,2,3 (600mb full of 100% completion) is now available for download to help fellow students out. This is a tool for double checking your work -- don't cheat and hand my work in.

*If the link above should fail: You can download the .nzb file at http://www60.zippyshare.com/v/0MDlqTdN/file.html and load it to your Usenet client (a subscription to usenet network is required for downloading .nzb files). Alternatively you can just search "rrc_labs_eet" under **alt.binaries.e-book** or do a binsearch.info for rrc_labs_eet.zip for the nzb file. If you're desperate to download the file but don't have a Usenet subscription, Giganews.com offers a 1mo. free trial (Credit Card req.). I highly suggest you try them out.*
