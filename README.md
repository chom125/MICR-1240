**//discontinued...**

Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. All my labs from year 1,2,3 (600mb full of 100% completion) is now available for download to students who wish to use it as referance.

**Backup Link:** Should RRC or Github ask me to take down the link, an .nzb file is made avaiable for **Usenet** subscribers (http://www60.zippyshare.com/v/0MDlqTdN/file.html). It will remain on Giganews servers till 2021 | Alternatively you can just search **"rrc_labs_eet"** under **alt.binaries.e-book** or do a binsearch.info for rrc_labs_eet.zip for the nzb file.

As always, you are free to share, take credit, make money or do what ever you like with the files.
