Since I'm no longer a student at RRC, this repo (MICR-1240) will no longer be maintained. 

I've made all my labs from year 1,2,3 (all 600mb 100% completion) available for download to help students double check thier work. You can download the .nzb file at https://mega.nz/#!YE0kDRTL and load it to your Usenet client (a subscription to usenet network is required for downloading .nzb files). Alternatively you can just search "rrc_labs_eet" under **alt.binaries.e-book** or do a binsearch.info for rrc_labs_eet.zip for the nzb file.

If you are not familiar with Usenet, the front-end works similar to how BitTorrent works (the back-end is just Arpanet 2.0 aka Internet 0.1 alpha -- in a nut shell, its O.G. internet). Usenet is blazing fast, decentralized, and will retain the file for 5 years... which is why I chose to upload it there. 

If you're despirate to download the file but don't have a Usenet subscription, Giganews.com offers a 1mo. free trial (Credit Card req.). I highly suggest you try them out.
