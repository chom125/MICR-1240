The midterm is both theory and practical.
You have 2 hours to complete the exam.

The first hour is written portion, and the second hour is practical. You do not need to take
the full hour and the hour can extend to your practical hour, however it is advisable to finish
the written potion as soon as you can. The practical takes a lot more effort and work + time
to complete for many.

Another possibility is when the classroom size is big. In this case the class is split in two.
The exam still takes place in the same room, however the group will be divided in practical and 
theory group.

Written portion:
	- know your keypad (what hex value is given when a button is pressed)
	- know how to read the datasheet (the command code specifically)
